### A simple Node.js run scraper for a real estate listings website [Aruodas.lt](https://aruodas.lt).

Example config file is provided, but one MUST copy it as `./config.json`

After that, app can be run with `npm run start`.

Still a WIP.

## TODO:

* [ ] Implement Chromium parsing(need to bypass cURL and other bot detection measures);
* [ ] Add Discord webhook message sends
